# Introduction to Deep Learning
Deep Learning, in comparison to usual Machine Learning, benefits from its ability to use unstructured data. This includes images and text.

Deep Learning is a rapidly growing field. Lots of money, but it's not good for everything:
* Require lots of data  
* Can be computationally expensive
* Can be difficult to interpret  

Constantly evolving means constantly changing, therefore there's much to learn.

## Class Logistics
### Lecture  
In person lectures are available in addition to live Zoom and recordings.

### Homework
Consists of 80% of total grade. Usually will be implementing neural network frameworks, and goofing around with PyTorch. Can be done in pairs. Homework will be hosted on Google CoLab.
